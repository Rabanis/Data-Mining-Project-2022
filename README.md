# Data-Mining-Project-2022
Project that was being developed during my undergraduate courses at CEID for the course of Data Mining.

This project was divided into 2 parts. In the 1st part, many CSV datasets were given which included power
consumption of the California State for the span of 3 years with 5' intervals between each entry. 

will be completed later on.
